        <h1>Duration Picker</h1>
        <p>
        This is a simple vanilla javascript implementation of an extensible time duration picker.
        It is extremely extensible in the sense that you provide your own description of a duration.
        </p>
        <h2>Description Format</h2>
        <p>
        To initialize a duration picker, you must specify the labels, and what they mean to you.
        If you want an input for choosing minutes and seconds, then you specify that the labels are "minutes" and "seconds."
        You must also tell the plugin that 1 minute = 60 seconds And 1 "second" = 1 second.
        If you need to, you can also specify a min and max value, you might do this if you have an "hours" input and you don't want the user to say something like 1 hour and 70 minutes.
        You may omit the max field if you want to allow any value.
        Here's what a basic minutes/seconds picker looks like:
<pre>
<code>
let secondsPicker = new DurationPicker('js-seconds-picker', {
    seconds: {
        seconds: 1,
        min: 0
    }
});
</code>
</pre>
        </p>

        <h2>Seconds Picker</h2>
        <div id="js-seconds-picker"></div>
        <button type="button" id="js-seconds-button">Get Time</button>
        <p>Seconds: <span id="js-seconds-time"></span></p>
        <p>This is created from the code above, click Get Time to see what it returns</p>

        <h3>Hours, Minutes, and Seconds</h3>
        <p>
        The above example isn't very interesting.
        All you can really see is that it's returning the same thing as itself.
        Nothing a normal <code>input.value</code> can't do already.
        This time, let's add hours, minutes and seconds together.
<pre>
let timePicker = new DurationPicker('js-time-picker', {
    hours: {
        seconds: 3600,
        min: 0
    },
    minutes: {
        seconds: 60,
        min: 0
    },
    seconds: {
        seconds: 1,
        min: 0
    }
});
</pre>
        <div id="js-time-picker"></div>
        <button type="button" id="js-time-button">Get Time</button>
        <p>Seconds: <span id="js-time-time"></span></p>
        <p>Try it out</p>

        <h2>Years, Months, Days, Hours, Minutes, and Seconds</h2>
        <p>
        Above is about where many plugins end.
        But this one is built to be extensible.
        You can go as high as you want. Let's add years and months to our picker.
<pre>
let yearPicker = new DurationPicker('js-time-picker', {
    years: {
        seconds: 3.154e+7,
        min: 0
    },
    months: {
        seconds: 2.628e+6,
        min: 0
    },
    days: {
        seconds: 86400,
        min: 0
    },
    hours: {
        seconds: 3600,
        min: 0
    },
    minutes: {
        seconds: 60,
        min: 0
    },
    seconds: {
        seconds: 1,
        min: 0
    }
});
</pre>
        </p>
        <div id="js-year-picker"></div>
        <button type="button" id="js-year-button">Get Time</button>
        <p>Seconds: <span id="js-year-time"></span></p>

        <h2>Warbles, Jips, and Beeps</h2>
        <p>
        By now, you should have noticed that the plugin doesn't know what years, or months, or really even what minutes are.
        It barely knows what seconds are, though we have to tell it that 1 "second" is 1 second, and that 1 minute is 60 seconds.
        So you could really call these things whatever you want. Maybe a Warble is 100 seconds, a Jip is 50 seconds, and a Beep is 13 seconds.
        Then you have this:
<pre>
let warblePicker = new DurationPicker('js-warble-picker', {
    warbles: {
        seconds: 100,
        min: 0
    },
    jips: {
        seconds: 50,
        min: 0
    },
    beep: {
        seconds: 13,
        min: 0
    }
});
</pre>
        <div id="js-warble-picker"></div>
        <button type="button" id="js-warble-button">Get Time</button>
        <p>Seconds: <span id="js-warble-time"></span></p>
        </p>

        <h2>Domain Agnostic</h2>
        <p>
        If you're clever, you may realize this type of description means that the same idea can be applied to any conversion into a base unit.
        In the above examples we're turning minutes, hours, etc. into seconds, the base unit.
        The only reason we specify seconds in the description is that this was built to be a time picker.
        You could do rotations. Or a conversion from inches into centimeters. Or anything else
        </p>

        <h3>Rotations</h3>
<pre>
let rotationPicker = new DurationPicker('js-rotation-picker', {
    revolutions: {
        seconds: 360
    },
    degrees: {
        seconds: 1
    }
});
</pre>
        <div id="js-rotation-picker"></div>
        <button type="button" id="js-rotation-button">Get Degrees</button>
        <p>Degrees: <span id="js-rotation-time"></span></p>

        <h3>Unit Conversions</h3>
<pre>
let centimeterPicker = new DurationPicker('js-centimeter-picker', {
    inches: {
        seconds: 2.54
    }
});
</pre>
        <div id="js-centimeter-picker"></div>
        <button type="button" id="js-centimeter-button">Get Centimeters</button>
        <p>Centimeters: <span id="js-centimeter-time"></span></p>

        <h2>Description Properties</h2>
        <p>
        This is a new project, so there aren't many constraints yet.
        You'll notice throughout the example I set <code>min: 0</code> for many objects.
        This applies a constraint that won't allow the user to enter a value below 0.
        You can also specify a <code>max: number</code>.
        </p>
